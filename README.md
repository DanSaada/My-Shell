# My-Shell
This is a versatile shell project implemented in the C programming language. It offers a range of essential features for command-line interaction. Users can perform fundamental tasks such as changing directories (using 'cd'), listing directory contents ('ls'), and executing any command accessible within the system's PATH environment variable. In addition to these core functionalities, the shell maintains a comprehensive command history, making it easy for users to access and review their prior commands by typing 'history'.
